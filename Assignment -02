Introduction
 Comparative genomics is the study of the relationship of genome structure and
function across different biological species or strains. Comparative genomics is an attempt to
take advantage of the information provide by the signatures of selection to understand
the function and evolutionary processes that act on genomes. While it is still a young field, it
holds great promise to yield insights into many aspects of the evolution of modern
species. The sheer amount of information contained in modern genomes (750 megabytes in
humans)necessitates that the methods of comparative genomics are utomated. Gene finding
is an important application of
